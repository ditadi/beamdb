# Compression Strategy Decision

## Status
In Analysis

## Context
BeamDB needs to evaluate compression strategies considering its core mission of speed-first OLTP with sub-millisecond latency requirements. The decision impacts:
- Processing overhead
- Storage efficiency
- Access patterns
- System complexity
- Overall latency

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Comprehensive Compression
- Full data compression across all pages
- Advanced compression algorithms
#### Pros
- Maximum storage efficiency
- Reduced I/O bandwidth
- Lower storage costs
#### Cons
- High CPU overhead
- Added latency for decompression
- Complexity in implementation
- Impact on random access patterns

### Option 2: No Compression
- Direct data storage without compression
- Raw data access
#### Pros
- Lowest possible latency
- No CPU overhead
- Simpler implementation
- Better for random access
#### Cons
- Higher storage requirements
- More I/O bandwidth needed
- Potentially higher costs

### Option 3: Selective Compression
- Compress only specific data types/states
- Lightweight compression where beneficial
#### Pros
- Balance of benefits
- Targeted optimization
- Flexible implementation
#### Cons
- More complex decision logic
- Varied performance characteristics
- Higher implementation complexity

## Decision
BeamDB will implement a minimal compression strategy focused on selective optimization.

### Rationale
1. **OLTP Workload Characteristics**
  - Small transactions
  - Random access patterns
  - High operation frequency
  - Need for immediate data access

2. **Performance Requirements**
  - Sub-millisecond latency target
  - CPU overhead concerns
  - Modern storage system efficiency
  - Random I/O capabilities

3. **Implementation Strategy**
  - No compression for hot/active data
  - Dictionary encoding for high-cardinality fields
  - Potential compression for archived data
  - Lightweight compression schemes where beneficial

## Implementation Notes
1. Focus Areas:
  - Smaller page sizes (4-8KB)
  - Efficient page layout
  - Direct data access paths
  - Smart buffer pool management

2. Selective Compression:
  - Dictionary encoding for strings
  - Cold data compression
  - Archive compression
  - Monitoring and adaptation
