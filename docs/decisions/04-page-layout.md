# Page Layout Decision

## Status
In Analysis

## Context
BeamDB needs an efficient page layout scheme that supports:
- High-speed transaction processing
- Efficient space utilization
- Simple and fast record access
- Concurrent operations
- Dynamic content management

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Slotted Page Layout
- Traditional approach using slot array and tuple data
- Header contains metadata and slot directory
- Variable-length data management
#### Pros
- Efficient space management
- Good for variable-length data
- Simple implementation
- Fast record access
- Well-understood concurrency patterns
#### Cons
- Some space overhead for slot array
- Potential internal fragmentation
- Need for periodic compaction

### Option 2: Log-Structured Page Layout
- Append-only page format
- Log records for changes
- Version chain for updates
#### Pros
- Efficient for writes
- Simple append operations
- Good for MVCC
#### Cons
- Complex read patterns
- Need for page-level compaction
- Higher implementation complexity
- More complex space management

## Decision
BeamDB will implement Slotted Page Layout as its primary page organization scheme.

### Rationale
1. **Alignment with Use Case**
   - Perfect for random access patterns
   - Efficient for small transactions
   - Simpler implementation
   - Better for concurrent access

2. **Technical Benefits**
   - Direct tuple access
   - Efficient space reclamation
   - Simple update mechanisms
   - Well-suited for OLTP workloads

3. **Operational Advantages**
   - Easier debugging and maintenance
   - Widely understood implementation
   - Better tooling support
   - Simpler recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Notes
1. Key Features:
   - Optimized slot directory
   - Efficient space management
   - Fast tuple location
   - Concurrency control support

2. Considerations:
   - Page size optimization
   - Slot array growth strategy
   - Free space management
   - Compaction triggers
