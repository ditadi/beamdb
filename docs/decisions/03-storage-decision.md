# Storage Organization Strategy Decision

## Status
In analysis

## Context
BeamDB needs to support different workload patterns while maintaining its speed-first philosophy. Instead of choosing a single storage organization, we can provide configurable strategies.

## Decision
Implement multiple storage organization strategies that can be selected based on workload characteristics:

### Strategies

1. **Speed-Balanced (Default)**
   - Uses Tuple-Oriented Storage
   - Optimized for mixed read/write
   - Best for typical OLTP workloads
   - Default configuration

2. **Write-Optimized**
   - Uses Log-Structured Storage
   - Optimized for write-heavy workloads
   - Best for append-heavy operations
   - Higher write throughput

3. **Hybrid Mode**
   - Combines both approaches
   - Hot data in Tuple-Oriented for fast access
   - Write buffer using Log-Structured
   - Background process to merge and optimize
